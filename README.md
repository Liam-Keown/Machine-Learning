# Machine-Learning

This repository shows my personaly projects in which I have been practicing and expanding my ML repertiore.

It contains 2 Time-series NN projects that are sport related and 3 that are to do with a simple sentiment analysis
in which film reviews are given positive and negative labels. 

One of the files deals with extracting and cleaning the stanford sentiment analysis datasets so they are ready for model analysis.

One is supervised learning using TF-IDF vectorisation and a linear SVC model to classify the movie reviews.

The other is unsupervised and uses a DBScan model to try and see any deeper differences than just 'positive' and 'negative' in the reviews.
